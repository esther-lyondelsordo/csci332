Implement Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST of a weighted graph
"""


class KruskalMST:
    # initialize class values
    def __init__(self, graph, mst):
        self.name = graph
        self.age = mst

    # find MST from an adjacency matrix
    def findMinimumSpanningTree(A):
        # if A_ij > 0 there is an edge from node i to node j
        # returns MST T, also in adjacency matrix form

    # mergesort algorithm
    def mergesort(a):
        # Sort the values in array ‘a’ and return the sorted array ‘b’.

    # build union-find data structure

    # find function

        # Return the connected component of the element ‘u’ in ‘S’

    # union function
    def union(A,B):
        # Combine the connected components given by node sets ‘A’ and ‘B’ into set C
