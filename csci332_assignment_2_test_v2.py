# Create adjacency list for the image
# This method takes an image as input and returns
# an adjacency list (python dictionary).  This method is used in my inside 
# my implementaiton of segmentImage.    
# Note: You are not required to have this function or this particular I/O.

# Convert adjacency list to matrix

# Note: You are not required to have this function or this I/O

# Display adjacency matrix for pixels at location (0,0) and (1,0) 
# In a 3x3 image, this corresponds to rows 0 and 3 in an adjacency matrix
# You are *required* to display an adjacency matrix for these two pixels, although
# the precise way in which you do it is up to you. 
# Note: the last two columns of my adjacency matrix represent a source and target node, respectively. 
#   In this matrix, non-zero values represent edge capacities.  
#
# Note: You may alternatively dispaly adjacency list output instead of an adjacency matrix, 
#     as long as the contents are *clearly* explained
